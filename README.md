# Graphics-
This project  is about a graphics animation of a tennis game using the `cs1graphics` library. It displays a tennis field with players, a ball, and various elements. The animation simulates the movement of the ball and players using loops and transformations and creation of a text object that moves to display the points scored in the game.
